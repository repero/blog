Repero was created out of the need for a simple system to handle Repairs and customer information.

It was originally made for the needs of a Bicycle repair shop in Iceland, [Hjolasprettur](https://hjolasprettur.is) which has been using the system since 2017.

Now the system has been modified so it can handle repairs for any kind of repair shop such as a:
* Mobile repair shop
* Jewelry repair shop
* Computer repair shop
* etc


### Main Features include
* Save all customer information online
* Notify customers with emails and SMS

### Timeline
* 2012 First version of a primitive system written in PHP 
* 2016 Work began on a complete rewrite using Ruby on Rails
* 2017 Repero is launched, offering monthly based subscription
