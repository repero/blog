These are the most noticable features being added the last months:

## When searching for a client, and the name does not exist.
* A button now appears to allow you to create a client with that name.
* Example: You click Clients, and search for the name 'Harold' and no 'Harold' is found.
* A button appears below '+ Harold'
* You click the button which takes you to the New Client page, where the name 'Harold' has been filled out.


## Added A 'virtual tour'
* Added a '? Help' button in the nav menu to demonstrate how the system works
* This will likely evolve to be more useful

## Confirmation when an email has been delivered
* When an email has been successfully sent to a client, the repair will get a comment like 'Email delivered'
* Now you can be sure that the clients email address was not misspelled, and the email was delivered to his inbox

## Telephones have the option to have different area codes
* Eeach user can have 2 phones, with different area code ( different countries ) if needed.
* If no telephone number is given, it uses the country the Shop is in

## Optimize the use of the TAB key.
* Users can now use the TAB key on the keyboard to jump faster between fields when inserting data in forms and searching for clients

## The system is available in multiple languages
* We are working on supporting more languages, for example (at the time of this writing):
* 100% English
* 100% French
* 60% German
* 80% Icelandic

## Adding images to a repair
* You can take a picture of every product you have and upload it to the cloud
